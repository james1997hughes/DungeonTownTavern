This font pack, from Seliel the Shaper, contains 3 true-type fonts for use in low-res retro games:

Mana Seed Title
An 8x8 pixel (mostly) font with a chonky feel.
Should be pixel-perfect at 8pt (or multiples of 8), unless your engine/editor is wonky.
Intended for names, titles and headers.
Strongly inspired by Seiken Densetsu 3 (Trials of Mana).

Mana Seed Title (monospace)
A monospace version, where each character occupies exactly 8x8.
Should be pixel-perfect at 8pt (or multiples of 8), unless your engine/editor is wonky.
This is what old games used to use, but may seem odd nowadays, since it leaves large gaps between narrow letters like i and l.

Mana Seed Body 
A 8x4 pixel (mostly) font with a compact, readable feel.
Should be pixel-perfect at 8pt (or multiples of 8), unless your engine/editor is wonky.
This one is intended for body text: NPC dialogue, quest details, menu text, etc.

Right now, only Mana Seed Body has accented characters, but if there's demand, I can add them to Mana Seed Title at a later date.
